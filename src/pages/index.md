title: Why choose written for?

heading: "Written for "
subheading: There is a difference when conveying "written to" and "written for"
description: When we say "written to", there is only 1 meaning in such
  statement. For example when we say "the mail is written to Bob", this sentence
  conveys that the mail is written and addressed to Bob. Now if we change the
  sentence to "the mail is written for Bob", it can either convey that the mail
  is written on behalf of Bob (because Bob has no time, no way to use his hands
  to write) or that the mail is being addressed to Bob. Written for is more
  vague but it fits perfectly for our blog title. What we have written in this
  website can be either addressed to myself or written to convey messages to the
  readers.
